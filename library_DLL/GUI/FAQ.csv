What are the blue lights?|Identifiable by blue lighting on lampposts, lampposts are located around the estate that have emergency help buttons on them. The emergency help buttons are easily identified on campus by their yellow boxes with a large red button. They are located on frequently travelled routes to create better access to emergency services along those areas. When the red button is pushed, the security team is alerted and will respond to the exact location where the button is activated.

Can I take a class that I don’t have the prerequisites for?|If you would like permission to waive the prerequisites for a class you’d like to take and feel that you have a strong basis to be able to do well in that class, you can email the Undergraduate Chair of the Department to ask for permission. If permission is granted in writing, please forward this to our office at ask.online@queensu.ca with your student number and preferred exam centre location so that we can assist you with enrolment. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis.
Where and when do I enroll in my courses?|You can enroll in your courses through SOLUS. You can find your enrolment appointment through SOLUS as well. 
How do I add my name to a waitlist for a course?|As step 1 of the enrolment process in SOLUS, you'll be given the option to check a box titled "Waitlist if class is full." If there is space on the waitlist for that class, you'll be added and given a "position number" that you can track. As spaces in the class open up, students on the waitlist will be enrolled in priority sequence. This can happen at any point up until the add/drop period for that semester.
